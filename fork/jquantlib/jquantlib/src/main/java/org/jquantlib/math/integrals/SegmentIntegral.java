/**
 * Integral of a one-dimensional function
 * <p>
 * Given a number {@latex$ N } of intervals, the integral of a function {@latex$ f } between {@latex$ a } and {@latex$ b }
 * is calculated by means of the trapezoid formula
 *
 * {@latex[
 *  \int_{a}^{b} f \mathrm{d}x = \frac{1}{2} f(x_{0}) + f(x_{1}) + f(x_{2}) + \dots + f(x_{N-1}) + \frac{1}{2} f(x_{N})
 * } where {@latex$ x_0 = a }, {@latex$ x_N = b }, and {@latex$ x_i = a+i \Delta x } with
 * {@latex$ \Delta x = (b-a)/N }.
