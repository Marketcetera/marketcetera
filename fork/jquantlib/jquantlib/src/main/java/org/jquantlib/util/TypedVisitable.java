 * certain kind of Visitor.

	/**
     * This method is intended to extend the semantics of method {@link Visitable#accept(Visitor)}
     * <p>
     * In a conventional Visitor design pattern, the <code>accept</code> method is called when access to visit a data structure is
     * requested. A {@link Visitor} object is passed as argument in case permission is granted to that {@link Visitor} to access the
     * data structure. Obviously, {@link Visitor}s and {@link Visitable}s work in pairs and the class which provides the data
     * structure to be visited also implements {@link Visitable} in order to properly grant access when the expected {@link Visitor}
     * is received.
     * <p>
     * In the case of a {@link TypedVisitable}, a {@link TypedVisitor} is passed instead of a {@link Visitor}. A
     * {@link TypedVisitor} is in fact, a composition of {@link Visitor}s and not only a single {@link Visitor}. A
     * {@link TypedVisitor} is responsible for returning the correct {@link Visitor} responsible for processing a certain data
     * structure.
     * <p>
     * The initial design of pairs made of &lt;{@link Visitor},{@link Visitable}&gt; is extended to a concept of a matrix made
     * of multiple {@link Visitor}s against multiple {@link Visitable}s. Every class which implements {@link TypedVisitable}
     * passes different data structures when querying {@link TypedVisitor}s.
     * 
     * @param v
     *            is a {@link TypedVisitor} which keeps data structures extended from <code>T</code>
     *            
     * @see TypedVisitor#getVisitor(Class)
