 * Container for historical data
 * <p>
 * This class acts as a generic repository for a set of historical data.
 * Any single datum can be accessed through its date, while
 * sets of consecutive data can be accessed through iterators.
 * <p>
 * This class is intended to keep closest compatibility with QuantLib/C++ as possible, being
 * nothing more than a shortcut to class {@link Series}, where the first parametric type is
 * fixed as {@link Date}.
