/**
 * Forward rate agreement (FRA) class
 * <p>
 *  1. Unlike the forward contract conventions on carryable
 *     financial assets (stocks, bonds, commodities), the
 *     valueDate for a FRA is taken to be the day when the forward
 *     loan or deposit begins and when full settlement takes place
 *     (based on the NPV of the contract on that date).
 *     maturityDate is the date when the forward loan or deposit
 *     ends. In fact, the FRA settles and expires on the
 *     valueDate, not on the (later) maturityDate. It follows that
 *     (maturityDate - valueDate) is the tenor/term of the
 *     underlying loan or deposit
 * <p>
 *  2. Choose position type = Long for an "FRA purchase" (future
 *     long loan, short deposit [borrower])
 * <p>
 *  3. Choose position type = Short for an "FRA sale" (future short
 *     loan, long deposit [lender])
 * <p>
 *  4. If strike is given in the constructor, can calculate the NPV
 *     of the contract via NPV().
 * <p>
 *  5. If forward rate is desired/unknown, it can be obtained via
 *     forwardRate(). In this case, the strike variable in the
 *     constructor is irrelevant and will be ignored.
 *
 *  @todo Add preconditions and tests
 *
 *  @todo Should put an instance of ForwardRateAgreement in the
 *        FraRateHelper to ensure consistency with the piecewise
 *        yield curve.
 *
 *  @todo Differentiate between BBA (British)/AFB (French)
 *        [assumed here] and ABA (Australian) banker conventions
 *        in the calculations.
 *
 *  @warning This class still needs to be rigorously tested
 *
