/**
 * Cumulative Poisson distribution function
 * <p>
 * This function provides an approximation of the integral of the Poisson
 * distribution.
 * <p>
 * In probability theory and statistics, the Poisson distribution is a discrete
 * probability distribution that expresses the probability of a number of events
 * occurring in a fixed period of time if these events occur with a known
 * average rate and independently of the time since the last event. The Poisson
 * distribution can also be used for the number of events in other specified
 * intervals such as distance, area or volume.
