 * A ListEvent models a change to a list.
 *
 * <p>The lists may change over time, causing this sequence of changes to grow
 * indefinitely. The event is accessed like an iterator, with the user calling
 * next() repeatedly to view the changes in sequence.
 *
 * <p>It is also possible to view changes in blocks, which may provide some
 * performance benefit. To use this, use the nextBlock() method instead of the
 * next() method.
