/**
 * Abstract base implementation of all classpath container initializer.
 * Loadpath variable containers are used in conjunction with the
 * "org.rubypeople.rdt.core.classpathContainerInitializer" extension point.
 * <p>
 * Clients should subclass this class to implement a specific classpath
 * container initializer. The subclass must have a public 0-argument
 * constructor and a concrete implementation of <code>initialize</code>.
 * <p>
 * Multiple classpath containers can be registered, each of them declares
 * the container ID they can handle, so as to narrow the set of containers they
 * can resolve, in other words, a container initializer is guaranteed to only be 
 * activated to resolve containers which match the ID they registered onto.
 * <p>
 * In case multiple container initializers collide on the same container ID, the first
 * registered one will be invoked.

    /**
     * Binds a classpath container to a <code>IClasspathContainer</code> for a given project,
     * or silently fails if unable to do so.
     * <p>
     * A container is identified by a container path, which must be formed of two segments.
     * The first segment is used as a unique identifier (which this initializer did register onto), and
     * the second segment can be used as an additional hint when performing the resolution.
     * <p>
     * The initializer is invoked if a container path needs to be resolved for a given project, and no
     * value for it was recorded so far. The implementation of the initializer would typically set the 
     * corresponding container using <code>JavaCore#setClasspathContainer</code>.
     * <p>
     * A container initialization can be indirectly performed while attempting to resolve a project
     * classpath using <code>IJavaProject#getResolvedClasspath(</code>; or directly when using
     * <code>JavaCore#getClasspathContainer</code>. During the initialization process, any attempt
     * to further obtain the same container will simply return <code>null</code> so as to avoid an
     * infinite regression of initializations.
     * <p>
     * A container initialization may also occur indirectly when setting a project classpath, as the operation
     * needs to resolve the classpath for validation purpose. While the operation is in progress, a referenced 
     * container initializer may be invoked. If the initializer further tries to access the referring project classpath, 
     * it will not see the new assigned classpath until the operation has completed. Note that once the Java 
     * change notification occurs (at the end of the operation), the model has been updated, and the project 
     * classpath can be queried normally.
	 * <p>
	 * This method is called by the Java model to give the party that defined
	 * this particular kind of classpath container the chance to install
	 * classpath container objects that will be used to convert classpath
	 * container entries into simpler classpath entries. The method is typically
	 * called exactly once for a given Java project and classpath container
	 * entry. This method must not be called by other clients.
	 * <p>
	 * There are a wide variety of conditions under which this method may be
	 * invoked. To ensure that the implementation does not interfere with
	 * correct functioning of the Java model, the implementation should use
	 * only the following Java model APIs:
	 * <ul>
	 * <li>{@link JavaCore#setClasspathContainer(IPath, IJavaProject[], IClasspathContainer[], org.eclipse.core.runtime.IProgressMonitor)}</li>
	 * <li>{@link JavaCore#getClasspathContainer(IPath, IJavaProject)}</li>
	 * <li>{@link JavaCore#create(org.eclipse.core.resources.IWorkspaceRoot)}</li>
	 * <li>{@link JavaCore#create(org.eclipse.core.resources.IProject)}</li>
	 * <li>{@link IJavaModel#getJavaProjects()}</li>
	 * <li>Java element operations marked as "handle-only"</li>
	 * </ul>
	 * The effects of using other Java model APIs are unspecified.
