    Strategy Agent provides an environment for a collection of modules to run
    and participate in data flows.
</p>
<h3>Command Line</h3>
<pre>
Syntax:
        strategyagent [commands_file]
</pre>
<p>
    The Strategy agent optionally accepts a file containing a limited set
    of commands that are executed as soon as the agent is started.
</p>
<p>
    Once started, the strategy agent waits until stopped. To shutdown the Strategy
    Agent, simply kill the process: it has appropriate shutdown hooks
    registered to stop all its activity before it shuts down.
</p>
<p>
    The commands_file contains one command per line. Commands cannot span
    multiple lines. Each line has a command name followed by a semicolon ';',
    followed by command specific syntax to supply parameters to the particular
    command.
    Lines beginning with '#' character and empty lines
    are ignored. The following commands are supported in the commands file:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>createModule</li>
    <li>startModule</li>
    <li>createDataFlow</li>
</ul>
<br/>
<h3>createModule</h3>
<pre>
Syntax:
        createModule;providerURN;create_parameters
</pre>
<ul>
    <li><code>providerURN</code> is the URN of the module provider whose instance
    is being created.</li>
    <li><code>create_parameters</code> is the list of parameters that are being
    supplied to create the module instance per the syntax specified in
    {@link org.marketcetera.module.ModuleManagerMXBean} documentation.</li>
</ul>    

<p>
    For example:
</p>
<pre>
    # Create a module instance of provider metc:surface:color
    # First parameter is a module instance URN value
    #       metc:surface:color:red
    # Second parameter is a URL value
    #       http://red.com
    # Third parameters is a string value
    #       username
    # Fourth parameter is a double value
    #       12.43
    createModule;metc:surface:color;metc:surface:color:red,http://red.com,username,12.43

</pre>
<br/>
<h3>startModule</h3>
<pre>
Syntax:
        startModule;instanceURN
</pre>
<ul>
    <li><code>instanceURN</code> is the URN of the module instance that
        is being started.</li>
</ul>
<p>
    For example:
</p>
<pre>
    # Starts a module instance with the URN metc:surface:color:red
    startModule;metc:surface:color:red

</pre>
<br/>
<h3>createDataFlow</h3>
<pre>
Syntax:
        createDataFlow;data_flow_request
</pre>
<ul>
    <li><code>data_flow_request</code> is a string specifying the detail
        of the data flow that is being setup, per the syntax specified in the
    {@link org.marketcetera.module.ModuleManagerMXBean} documentation.</li>
</ul>
<p>
    Do note that since this command invokes the
    {@link org.marketcetera.module.ModuleManagerMXBean#createDataFlow(String)}
    API to create the data flow, the sink module is always automatically
    appended to every data flow being created.
</p>
<p>
    For example:
</p>
<pre>
    # Sets up a data flow with the module instance matching the URN
    # 'metc:mdata' emitting data based on the request parameter 'symbol=ibm',
    # the strategy module instance matching the URN 'metc:strategy::vegas'
    # processing the data and the sink module receiving all the data.
    createDataFlow;metc:mdata;symbol=ibm^metc:strategy::vegas

</pre>
<br/>
<h3>Module Providers</h3>
<p>
    The module jars can be added to the
    agent by copying them into the <code>modules/jars</code> sub-directory.
    The Strategy Agent discovers all the jars when it's initialized. If new
    jars are added after the agent has been started, the strategy agent
    can be asked to discover them by invoking the
    {@link org.marketcetera.module.ModuleManagerMXBean#refresh()} API via
    JMX.
</p>
<h3>Classloading</h3>
<p>
    The strategy agent uses a {@link java.net.URLClassLoader} instance to
    load provider classes from the <code>modules/jars</code> sub-directory.
    Since a custom classloader is used, the system classloader cannot find
    any of the provider classes.
</p>
<p>
    This is usually not a problem unless the provider code depends on the thread's
    context classloader to be set to a classloader that is able to load all
    the provider classes. Many third party libraries do depend on the thread context
    classloader value to be able to correctly load classes.
</p>
<p>
    The strategy agent sets the thread context classloader to the custom
    classloader that is used to load the providers before loading any of the
    provider classes. This ensures that the provider code is invoked with
    the thread context classloader set to the same classloader that loaded it.
    Moreover, the module manager ensures that the thread context classloader
    is set to the custom classloader when any module manager MXBean operations
    or factory / instance MXBean operations are invoked.
</p>
<h3>Module Configuration</h3>
<p>
    The Strategy Agent uses the
    {@link org.marketcetera.module.PropertiesConfigurationProvider} to
    provide default property values to the module factories and instances.
    The properties files, having appropriate names and key-value pairs
    as described in the property configuration provider documentation,
    can be copied into the <code>modules/conf</code> sub-directory.
</p>
<h3>Management and Monitoring</h3>
<p>
    The primary means of controlling the Strategy Agent is via JMX. Once
    the strategy agent is up and running, clients can connect to its platform
    MBean server and control its operation via the
    {@link org.marketcetera.module.ModuleManagerMXBean} interface.
</p>
<h3>Logging</h3>
<p>
    The Strategy Agent is configured to print informational messages
    from the agent and all the data received by the sink module to its console.
    The rest of the messages are copied to its log file in the <code>log</code>
    sub-directory.
    The logging configuration is done via the <code>log4j.properties</code>
    file in the <code>conf</code> sub-directory.
    The category names for Strategy Agent and sink messages are
    <code>org.marketcetera.strategyagent.StrategyAgent</code> and
    <code>SINK</code>, the logging configuration for these two categories
    can be altered to change what messages are printed on the strategyagent
    console.
