    <h1>Overview</h1>
    <p>The Financial Information eXchange ("FIX") Protocol is a specification of interaction
    techniques and formats for traders, brokers and other parties to electronic trading.
    The FIX Protocol <a href="http://www.fixprotocol.org/">website</a> further clarifies:</p>
    <blockquote>
    More precisely, the
    FIX Protocol is a series of messaging specifications developed through the
    collaboration of banks, broker-dealers, exchanges, industry utilities and
    associations, institutional investors, and information technology providers
    from around the world. These market participants share a vision of a common,
    global language for automated trading of securities, derivative, and other
    financial instruments.
    </blockquote>

    <p>The specification entails two important message types.  First, the "application messages"
    represent common requests and updates that travel between between parties, for example
    a new limit order, a cancel, or a fill.  Second, the specification requires parties to
    exchange messages about the connection itself.  These "session messages" ensure that both
    sides of a conversation are aware of events like the begin or end of a session, or the
    receipt of malformed messages.</p>

    <p>In addition the specification includes a significant amount of semantic information for
    each of the messages--that is information about what the messages mean, and how they should
    be interpreted.  See the Resources section below for links to FIX reference materials.</p>

    <p>The FIX protocol currently exists in 5 variants, versions 4.0 through 4.4.  The "first"
    version of the protocol, 4.0, contains just specifications of the messages required to effect
    a simple equity transaction between a customer and a broker.  With each successive release of
    the protocol, more functionality was added, including options, futures and fixed income orders,
    third party transactions, and security description messages.  In practice, at the time of this writing
    most equity brokers support 4.0, 4.1 or 4.2.  Note that the versions are not--in general--backward
    compatible.</p>

    <h1>FIX and the Marketcetera Platform</h1>
        <p>
            The Marketcetera platform uses the entire FIX protocol for communication with brokers and other
            counterparties.  For internal communications, the platform uses the FIX application message
            formats and semantics but does not necessarily implement the session level requirements
            Currently the Marketcetera platform supports only version 4.2 of the FIX protocol.
        </p>
        <p>
            Marketcetera uses the QuickFIX/J Engine (part of the QuickFIX project, see Resources below)
            to manage fix connections to counterparties.
