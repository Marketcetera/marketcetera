# test.eclipse.host denotes the Eclipse installation which is the host for the test run.
# The directory given here is expected to have an eclipse subdirectory.
# The default is to use the same host as the build host but in general this should be changed to
# a separate installation. You can also set this directory to a non existing location and provide
# a zip file (see next property) which will then be extracted. 
# The test host does not have to be a full Java/PDE SDK, the Eclipse platform is fully sufficient. Please ALWAYS USE FORWARD SLASHES.

# If you specify a non existing test.eclipse.host, you can provide a zipped Eclipse installation here,
# e.g. eclipse-platform-3.3.1.1-win32.zip. You can set the test.eclipse.host to a subdirectory of the 
# buildDirectory if you want to have a fresh installation for every test run, e.g. test.eclipse.host=${buildDirecotory}/testhost
