    Contains unit test classes for testing persistence infrastructure features. Includes
    base classes that can be used for unit testing entities and queries that are created
    using the persistence infrastructure.
</p>
<p>
    For unit testing entities, for each entity, create a unit test class that extends
    {@link org.marketcetera.persist.EntityTestBase} or
    {@link org.marketcetera.persist.NDEntityTestBase} depending on whether the entity
    extends {@link org.marketcetera.persist.EntityBase} or
    {@link org.marketcetera.persist.NDEntityBase}.
    Implement all the abstract methods in the class and over-ride appropriate methods
    if your entity has additional attributes. If the entity doesn't declare any
    additional attributes, you likely do not need to over-ride any methods.
    See subclasses of these two test base classes for examples.
    Do add additional unit tests for operations / behavior specific to the entity. ie.
    features that are implemented by the entity.
    Make sure that all the attributes of the entity are initialized, including lazy
    loaded ones and relationship attributes, to ensure that entity is completely tested.
</p>
<p>
    For unit testing many to many relationships between entities, have a unit test
    that extends {@link org.marketcetera.persist.ManyToManyTestBase} and implement
    all the abstract methods.
    See subclasses of this class for examples.
