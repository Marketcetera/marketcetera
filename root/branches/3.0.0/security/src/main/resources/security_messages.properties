# This MUST be encoded in ISO-8859-1. To supply characters that are
# not supported by this encoding, use unicode escapes (\uxxxx).

# You may also create a separate file with a native encoding, and then
# use the 'native2ascii' tool of the Java Development Kit to convert
# that file into a this message file in ISO-8859-1. The same tool can
# do the reverse conversion using the '-reverse' command-line option.
