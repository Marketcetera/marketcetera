<p>Multi-context gathering of credentials for authentication.</p>

<p>A standard step in authentication is the gathering of user
credentials. Credentials typically comprise a username and a password,
but they can also include an authentication domain, certificates, or
other information specific to the authentication algorithm. This
package has no connection to authentication algorithms or even
interfaces (such as JAAS); it concerns itself only with gathering
credentials.</p>

<p>Credentials may come from multiples sources. For example a GUI
application may look for credentials in the following places:</p>

<ul>

<li>Configuration files.</li>

<li>Command-line options, which can override the configuration
files.</li>

<li>A login dialog box, displayed only if credentials were not
specified using either of the above methods.</li>

</ul>

<p>Each of the methods above seeks to gather credentials from a
specific <i>context</i> (configuration file(s), command-line, dialog
box). In this example, the command-line context is an <i>override</i>
context, meaning that it always attempts to gather credentials and, if
it does so successfully, the values it gathers override those provided
by earlier contexts. The login dialog is a non-override context
because it will only pop up and attempt to gather credentials if
they have not been gathered yet.</p>

<p>For the benefit of user convenience and uniformity, {@link
org.marketcetera.util.auth.StandardAuthentication} provides a standard
authentication system, aimed specifically at console applications. For
developers who wish to create non-standard authentication systems,
{@link org.marketcetera.util.auth.AuthenticationSystem} is a generic
registry of contexts. Contexts extend {@link
org.marketcetera.util.auth.Context}, and several subclasses are
provided, such as command-line or Spring configuration. The package
design can accomodate any number/type of credentials sought (not just
a username and password), with some contexts capable of providing only
some of them. A creative developer may also repurpose this package to
retrieve any combination of application properties from multiple
contexts, not just authentication credentials.</p>

<p>All provided contexts treat null and "" (empty string) inputs as
no-ops, i.e. gathered credentials that are null or "" are treated as
if no credentials were supplied (and hence do not override values set
by earlier contexts).</p>
