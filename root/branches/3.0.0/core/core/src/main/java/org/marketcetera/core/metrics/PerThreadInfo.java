/**
 * Instances of this class keep track of per thread metrics. Following metrics
 * are kept track of.
 * <ol>
 * <li>Current: The metrics for the current iteration of the thread.</li>
 * <li>Saved: The metrics saved from the previous iterations of the thread.</li>
 * <li>Iterations: Total number of iterations.</li>
 * </ol>
 * <p>
 * The {@link ThreadedMetric} class keeps an instance of this class for
 * every thread being instrumented.
 * <p>
 * Here is the object graph that is maintained to keep track of all
 * instrumentation metrics
 * <ul>
 *   <li>{@link ThreadedMetric} keeps track of an instance of
 *   {@link PerThreadInfo} for each thread.</li>
 *   <ul>
 *     <li>{@link PerThreadInfo} keeps track of saved and current iteration
 *      info for each thread and it's total/cumulative iteration count.</li>
 *     <ul>
 *       <li>{@link IterationInfo} keeps track of the checkpoints within
 *        an iteration. It also keeps track of cumulative iteration count until
 *        the current iteration.</li>
 *       <ul>
 *         <li>{@link CheckpointInfo} keeps track of a checkpoint.</li>
 *       </ul>
 *     </ul>
 *   </ul>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>
 * The contents of this class and other info classes are only updated from
 * a single thread: the thread being instrumented. The contents are however
 * eventually read by a different thread when summarizing. The data structures
 * used should guarantee that the reads from a different thread generate
 * consistent & correct results.
