    This package provides the infrastructure for creating data flows between
    pluggable modules. The modules are independent pieces of functionality
    that may be packaged separately and may be supplied by different vendors.
</p>
<p>
    Data flow involves exchange of data of any type from a module that emits
    it, via a couple of modules that process it, to a module that consumes it.
</p>
<p>
    The data flows can be dynamically set up and canceled, throughout the life
    of the application. The modules' implementations can be dynamically added
    to the application however, there's no mechanism to remove module
    implementations from the system without stopping it.
</p>
<p>
    Each module can participate in data flows in any of the following capacities. 
</p>
<ul>
    <li>{@link org.marketcetera.module.DataEmitter Generating Data}</li>
    <li>{@link org.marketcetera.module.DataReceiver Consuming Data}</li>
    <li>{@link org.marketcetera.module.DataFlowRequester Creating Data Flows}</li>
</ul>
<p>
    Modules indicate their capabilities by implementing various interfaces
    linked above.
</p>
<p>
    {@link org.marketcetera.module.ModuleURN URNs} are used to uniquely identify module types & module
    instances.
</p>
<p>
    Requests to setup data flow between modules can either be initiated
    by a module, if it's designed to create data flows, when it's started.
    Or a request can be made to the framework to setup a
    data flow between multiple modules.
</p>
<p>
    The Module framework services are available via
    {@link org.marketcetera.module.ModuleManager}. Look at its documentation
    to figure out the services are offered by the module framework.
</p>
<h2>Concepts</h2>
<h3>Module Factory / Provider</h3>
<p>
    Module implementations are provided by indvidual Module Providers. Typically, module
    implementation from a single provider is bundled within a single jar. However,
    nothing prevents a module provider from bundling the modules in different jars.
</p>
<p>
    Each module provider provides a {@link org.marketcetera.module.ModuleFactory}
    implementation that creates new Module instances. The Module Framework discovers
    all the factory implementations available to its class loader and uses them to
    create new Module Instances as needed.
</p>
<p>
    Each provider has a URN that uniquely identifies the provider. The URNs of all
    the modules created by the provider always have the provider URN as its prefix.
</p>
<p>
    Each module factory creates modules that perform a certain type of function.
    There is a notion of factory/provider types, such that different implementations
    can provide similar kinds of functions. For example, there can be different
    implementations of market data providers, each providing market data
    from a different market data vendor.
</p>
<p>
    Each factory can support either multiple module instances or just one singleton
    module instance, depending on the feature they provide. For example, typically
    market data provider modules will have a singleton instance whereas strategy
    modules will have multiple instances, one per strategy.
</p>
<h3>Module</h3>
<p>
    A module is an entity that is capable of participating in data flows within the
    module framework. Each module is instantiated by a module factory. A module can
    emit data and / or receive data and / or request data flows.
</p>
<p>
    After being created by the factory, the module needs to started before it
    can start participating in the data flows. Each module receives a callback
    when it's started, to let the module initialize itself before it's started.
    Similarly a module can be stopped to prevent it from participating in
    any data flows. A module receives a callback when it's being stopped
    as well.
</p>
<h3>Provider/Module URN</h3>
<p>
    URNs of the following form are used everywhere in the system to identify
    Module Providers and Instances:
</p>
<pre>
    metc:provType:provider:instance
</pre>
<p>
    See {@link org.marketcetera.module.ModuleURN} for more details.
</p>
<p>
    The <code>provType</code> value in the URN serves to identify providers that provide
    modules that deliver similar kind of function. For example, <code>mdata</code> is
    used to identify all market data vendors, <code>cep</code> is used to identify all
    modules that provide Complex Event Processing functionality.
</p>
<p>
    For each <code>provType</code> a standard set of request type and data types are
    defined, allowing the modules to use modules that are from different providers but
    have the same <code>provType</code>, interchangeably. The documentation for the
    standard set of <code>provType</code> will be generated when the module
    implementations are being authored.
</p>
<p>
    The following standard provider types are currently envisioned:
</p>
<ol>
    <li><b>sink</b>: Universal sink for all kinds of data.
        Only capable of receiving data.</li>
    <li><b>mdata</b>: Generates market data. Only capable of emitting data.
        Needs definition of standard request parameters</li>
    <li><b>strategy</b>: Receives and Emits data. Optionally creates data flows as well.
        May need to define standard request parameters for generating trades v/s suggestions.</li>
    <li><b>cep</b>: Receives and Emits data. Performs complex event processing.
        Needs definition of standard request parameters.</li>
    <li><b>ors</b>: Receives trades and emits execution report data. Need to define
        standard request parameters for generating execution reports.</li>
</ol>
<h3>Module Framework</h3>
<p>
    The Module Framework provides an operating environment for these modules to exist
    and exchange data. It provides services, to list available providers, module
    instances and data flows between them, create / start / stop / delete modules
    and set up / tear down data flows between them.
    All the module framework services are offered by
    {@link org.marketcetera.module.ModuleManager} 
</p>
<p>
    The module framework also exports its services via JMX via
    {@link org.marketcetera.module.ModuleManagerMXBean}. The main client is
    jconsole, however this interface allows for the framework services to
    be programmatically accessed if needed.
</p>
<h3>Data Types</h3>
<p>
    Data Types are relevant for the following usages:
</p>
<ol>
    <li>Parameters supplied when creating a module instance.</li>
    <li>Parameters supplied when requesting data from emitter modules.</li>
    <li>Data Exchanged between modules</li>
</ol>
<p>
    Data of any type can be used for all these three usages. However, modules are
    strongly recommended to accept strings, in addition to any specific types they need,
    for usages 1 & 2 above.
</p>
<p>
    Module Framework API is available via an MXBean through JMX. And
    that API only supports string parameters for usages 1 & 2 above. The module
    framework automatically converts string parameters to actual java types,
    for a limited set of types listed below, for usage 1 above.
    To the extent modules support string
    parameters for usages 2 above, they will be usable via JMX interface.
    Otherwise, those modules (or subset of their functionalities that require
    non-string parameters) will not be usable in the standalone module container
    where all module framework functions are exposed via JMX.
</p>
<p>
    The module framework supports automatic conversion of strings to actual java
    types for the following java types.
</p>
<ul>
    <li>Java Primitive Types</li>
    <li>{@link java.math.BigDecimal}</li>
    <li>{@link java.math.BigInteger}</li>
    <li>{@link java.io.File}</li>
    <li>{@link java.net.URL}</li>
    <li>{@link org.marketcetera.module.ModuleURN}</li>
</ul>
<h2>Module Lifecycle</h2>
<p>
    Module instances can be created, started, stopped and deleted via services provided
    by {@link org.marketcetera.module.ModuleManager}. The module manager uses the
    provider specific {@link org.marketcetera.module.ModuleFactory} instance
    to create modules.
</p>
<p>
    Parameters can be optionally supplied to the module factory when requesting it to
    create new instances. Although these parameters can be of any type, modules are
    strongly recommended to support parameter types, that the module framework
    is capable of converting strings to, to enable their
    instantiation, via JMX, in the standalone module container environment.
</p>
<p>
    If a factory does not support
    {@link org.marketcetera.module.ModuleFactory#isMultipleInstances() multiple}
    module instances , its singleton module instance is created when the module
    framework is being initialized.
</p>
<p>
    If a factory is capable of
    {@link org.marketcetera.module.ModuleFactory#isAutoInstantiate() auto-instantiating}
    module instances, the module framework
    will automatically instantiate its module instances whenever the first data flow
    request identifying an instance that does not exist is issued. The module framework
    at that point will request the module factory to instantiate a module instance
    supplying it the module instance URN as a parameter.
    Any factory that is capable of auto-instantiating modules, should accept
    module URN as the one and only parameter to create the module instance. 
</p>
<p>
    If a created module designates itself as
    {@link org.marketcetera.module.Module#isAutoStart() auto-startable}, the module
    framework will automatically start the module as soon as it's created.
</p>
<h2>Module Packaging</h2>
<p>
    Each module implementation is packaged in a jar that has a file named
    <code>org.marketcetera.module.ModuleFactory</code> within the
    <code>META-INF/services</code>. The file contains fully qualified name
    of the ModuleFactory implementation that will instantiate Module(s)
    delivered by the provider.
    For more information see {@link java.util.ServiceLoader}
</p>
<p>
    Module Implementations can be added dynamically by making its classes
    available in the classpath and invoking
    {@link org.marketcetera.module.ModuleManager#refresh()}.
</p>

<h2>Emitting Data</h2>
<p>
    A module that can emit data should implement
    {@link org.marketcetera.module.DataEmitter}. When an emitter is
    requested to emit data, it's provided an
    {@link org.marketcetera.module.DataEmitterSupport}
    instance which can be used to emit data.
    A module can receive a request to emit data when it's in the
    {@link org.marketcetera.module.ModuleState#isStarted() started}
    state. 
</p>
<p>
    Each request is identified by a unique
    {@link org.marketcetera.module.RequestID} that is supplied to the module
    along with the request. This requestID is also supplied when the framework
    asks the module to cancel the request.
</p>
<p>
    The emitting module has an option to send any data emit errors via
    {@link org.marketcetera.module.DataEmitterSupport#dataEmitError(org.marketcetera.util.log.I18NBoundMessage,boolean)}
    It can also request that the data flow be stopped via that method.
</p>
<p>
    Although modules can accept request parameters of any type, they
    are strongly encouraged to be able to accept string requests, to
    enable their usage, via JMX, in the standalone module container
    environment.
</p>
<h2>Receiving Data</h2>
<p>
    A module that can receive data should implement
    {@link org.marketcetera.module.DataReceiver}. A receiver
    module can receive data anytime after it has been started.
    Data can be of type and the module can choose to throw
    {@link org.marketcetera.module.StopDataFlowException} if it
    wants the data flow thats sending it data to stop.
</p>

<h2>Setting up Data Flows</h2>
<p>
    There are two ways to set up data flows.
</p>
    <ol>
    <li>Data Flows initiated by a module instance.</li>
    <li>Data Flows initiated by a user / client of module framework.</li>
    </ol>
<p>
    A module can acquire the capability to initiate a data flow by implementing
    {@link org.marketcetera.module.DataFlowRequester}. It can then create and
    cancel data flows via {@link org.marketcetera.module.DataFlowSupport}.
    A module can request & cancel data flows when it's in the
    {@link org.marketcetera.module.ModuleState#isStarted() started} state.
    It's expected that a module will typically create data flows when it's started
    from within its {@link org.marketcetera.module.Module#preStart()} method.
    And that a module will typically cancel data flows when it's stopped from within
    its {@link org.marketcetera.module.Module#preStop()} method.
    A module cannot be stopped if it's participating in any data flows that it
    didn't initiate. As a convenience, the module framework stops all the data
    flows that a module had initiated but didn't stop from within its
    <code>preStop()</code> when it's being stopped.
</p>
<p>
    Any client of module framework can create and delete data flows by invoking
    {@link org.marketcetera.module.ModuleManager#createDataFlow(DataRequest[])} and
    {@link org.marketcetera.module.ModuleManager#cancel(DataFlowID)}.
</p>
<p>
    Once a data flow has been setup, its details and current status can be obtained by
    invoking {@link org.marketcetera.module.ModuleManager#getDataFlowInfo(DataFlowID)}. 
</p>
<h2>Module Configuration and Management</h2>
<p>
    The Module factory and individual instances can export MXBean interfaces
    that expose their attributes and operations to enable their management.
    Upon creation, if a factory or a module instance is found to be implementing
    an MXBean interface, it registers the MBean with the platform MBean server.
    Similarly, whenever a module instance is being deleted, the module framework
    unregisters its MBean from the platform MBean server.
</p>
<p>
    The MBeans, their attributes, methods and method parameters can be annotated
    with {@link org.marketcetera.module.DisplayName}, to specify descriptive text
    that will be available for viewing within the MBean's
    {@link javax.management.Descriptor}.
</p>
<p>
    The module framework functions are exported via
    {@link org.marketcetera.module.ModuleManagerMXBean}. All of its operations
    accept parameters of primitive & string types, so that they can be easily
    invoked by widely available jmx clients like jconsole. Operations to
    create module instances and data flows support special string syntax as
    these operations accept complex parameters. Look at the bean's class
    documentation for more details on these syntacies.  
</p>
<h3>Default Configuration</h3>
<p>
    Right after registering the module factory / instance's MBean with the
    platform MBean server, the module framework, will discover all the writable
    attributes of the MBean that are of types that can be converted from string
    to the actual types by the framework and will populate the their values
    using its default configuration initialization mechanism.
</p>
<p>
    The default configuration mechanism within the module framework, allows a
    {@link org.marketcetera.module.ModuleConfigurationProvider configuration provider}
    to be configured that provides a module container specific mechanism to
    obtain the default property values for a module.
    A particular implementation of this mechanism may obtain default property
    values from 
    {@link org.marketcetera.module.PropertiesConfigurationProvider property}
    files within the standalone module container.
    Another implementation may obtain the default value from the photon's
    preferences framework or XML files.
</p>
<h3>MXBeans</h3>
<p>
    The module framework, exports the Module Factory / Instance
    implementations as MXBeans if the instance implements an interface
    that is a MXBean interface. The Instance is wrapped in a proxy object
    before it's registered with the MBean server. The proxy object ensures
    that the thread context classloader is set for every method invocation
    on the MXBean implementation.
    After that, any JMX client can invoke
    operations on these MXBeans, register for their notifications or
    read / write their attributes. It's the responsibility of the
    Module factory / instance implementation to ensure if any of these
    operations are allowed based on its current state. For example,
    a module instance may not want to allow some of its attribute
    values to be changed while it's in the start state.
    In such cases, the module may choose to throw an exception disallowing
    such an attribute change.
</p>
<p>
    To be able to emit notifications, usually the MXBeans have to extend
    the {@link javax.management.NotificationBroadcasterSupport} class.
    However, the modules have to extend
    {@link org.marketcetera.module.Module} and hence they are not able to
    extend <code>NotificationBroadcasterSupport</code>. The recommendation
    here is to have the MXBean implement {@link javax.management.NotificationEmitter}
    instead and delegate to a private <code>NotificationBroadcasterSupport</code>
    instance instead.
</p>
<h4>Thread Context Classloader</h4>
<p>
    The module manager sets the thread context classloader when handling
    MBean method invocations on the module factories and instances to the
    same classloader as the one supplied to its constructor. This is useful
    when certain module implementations depend on libraries that need the
    thread context classloader set.
</p>
<h2>Sink Module</h2>
<p>
    A sink module is provided along with the framework that can be used to receive
    all the data that is being generated by the pipeline. The sink module has
    a singleton auto started instance with the URN
    <code>metc:sink:system:single</code>. The sink module is implicitly appended
    to all data flows, if possible.
</p>
<p>
    Other components of the application can receive all the data received by the
    sink module by implementing the
    {@link org.marketcetera.module.SinkDataListener} and registering it with
    the module manager via
    {@link org.marketcetera.module.ModuleManager#addSinkListener(SinkDataListener)}.
</p>
<p>
    The Sink module also exports a management interface via
    {@link org.marketcetera.module.SinkModuleMXBean}.
</p>
