= A list of bugs and other things discovered as a result of this test suite.

== Bugs
* Dir.chdir and '/'. See ruby-core: 8914.
* String#slice! documentation. See ruby-core: 9754.
* String#upto infinite loop bug. See ruby-core: 9864.
* Process::GID#eid= and Process::UID#eid= aliases. See ruby-core: 11022.

== Quirks, Inconsistencies and Other Stuff
* Math.atanh(1), and similar edge cases, raise different errors on different
  platforms (ERANGE vs EDOM). On MS Windows, no error is raised and Infinity
  is returned instead. See ruby-core: 10174.
* Some methods raise ArgumentError when they probably ought to return
  TypeError. Ruby is inconsistent on this, even within the same method. For
  example, ['test'].pack('C') raises a TypeError, while ['test'].pack('D')
  raises an ArgumentError. Many of these can be traced to the Integer() and
  Float() kernel methods.
* Some methods, such as File.join, allow you pass no arguments when they
  probably ought to check for 0 arguments and raise an ArgumentError. At the
  moment they're just no-ops.
* The chsize() function in MS VC++ 6.0 has a bug where it does not raise an
  error if you pass a negative value for the size argument. This affects the
  File.truncate method, i.e. it's a no-op instead of raising an error. MS
  VC++ 8.0 fixes this bug.
* Problems with File and File::Stat caused by an underlying bug in the
  Solaris stat() function, where the st_size member wasn't set properly.
