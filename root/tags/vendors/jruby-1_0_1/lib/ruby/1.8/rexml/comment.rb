		#   Internet Explorer is the worst piece of crap to have ever been
		#   written, with the possible exception of Windows itself.  Since IE is
		#   unable to parse proper XML, we have to provide a hack to generate XML
		#   that IE's limited abilities can handle.  This hack inserts a space 
		#   before the /> on empty tags.
