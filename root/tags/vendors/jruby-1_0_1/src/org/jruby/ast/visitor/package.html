Provide the infrastructure to apply the visitor pattern to the tree of nodes produced
by compiling a ruby script.

The Visitor pattern used here is slightly modified in that it uses a specific iterating
visitor to reify the tree navigation.  This is important since due to the different 
semantic of each node several meaningfull navigation can be implemented.
