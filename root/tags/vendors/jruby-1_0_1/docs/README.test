== Writing Tests

1. There are actually *3* core test suites:

   a) org.jruby.test.MainTestSuite, a suite of pure-java tests;

   b) org.jruby.test.ScriptTestSuite, which runs a suite of files named
   one-per-line in test/test_index (these are the so-called "minirunit" tests
   which use an antiquated testing framework);

   c) org.jruby.test.TestUnitTestSuite, which runs a suite of files named
   one-per-line in test/test_unit_index (note: some are currently commented).

2. If you'd like to contribute new tests, we'd prefer you write them in
Test::Unit and add to the test/test_unit_index file.

3. Naming conventions: testCamelCased.rb files are currently for
minirunit-based tests; test_under_scored.rb for Test::Unit tests.

4. We're also interested in running tests for other ruby software suites; if
you want to grab your favorite ruby software and run its own tests under JRuby
and report to the mailing list at dev@jruby.codehaus.org, that would be great.

5. Please file any and all patches in JIRA:
http://jira.codehaus.org/browse/JRUBY

== Running Tests

Using ant, type

  ant test

The three test suites should be run in order.
