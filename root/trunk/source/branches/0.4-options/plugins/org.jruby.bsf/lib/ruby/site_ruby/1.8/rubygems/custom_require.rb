  # We replace Ruby's require with our own, which is capable of
  # loading gems on demand.
  #
  # When you call <tt>require 'x'</tt>, this is what happens:
  # * If the file can be loaded from the existing Ruby loadpath, it
  #   is.
  # * Otherwise, installed gems are searched for a file that matches.
  #   If it's found in gem 'y', that gem is activated (added to the
  #   loadpath).
  #
  # The normal <tt>require</tt> functionality of returning false if
  # that file has already been loaded is preserved.
