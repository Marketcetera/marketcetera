<p>Miscellaneous utilities for file management.</p>

<p>This package complements the standard Java file handling facilities
and apache's {@link org.apache.commons.io.IOUtils}. These include:</p>

<ul>

<li><p>The {@link org.marketcetera.util.file.CopyBytesUtils}, {@link
org.marketcetera.util.file.CopyCharsUtils}, and {@link
org.marketcetera.util.file.CopyCharsUnicodeUtils} classes provide
utilities for copying data between files, streams, and memory, in
various combinations.</p></li>

<li><p>{@link org.marketcetera.util.file.FileType} offers symbolic
link detection and file typing, in the minimal fashion possible within
the platform-independent Java.</p></li>

<li><p>{@link org.marketcetera.util.file.SmartLinksDirectoryWalker}
offers recursive file tree traversal and {@link
org.marketcetera.util.file.Deleter} offers tree deletion; both are
sensitive to symbolic links.</p></li>

</ul>

<p>In addition to utilities, the package makes available a recommended
design pattern for handling streams safely via the supporting class
{@link org.marketcetera.util.file.CloseableRegistry}. When a series of
streams need to be opened and eventually closed, it is important that
such closures takes place in a timely fashion via explicit calls
to <code>close()</code>. This must happen even if an exception
interrupts normal processing, to ensure that the operating system does
not maintain locks on unused files or uses up file descriptors. Here
is the recommended approach for handling stream closure:</p>

<pre>
CloseableRegistry r=new CloseableRegistry();
try {
  ByteArrayOutputStream byteArray=new ByteArrayOutputStream();
  r.register(byteArray);
  PrintStream printStream=new PrintStream(byteArray);
  r.register(printStream);
  ... use printStream
} finally {
  r.close();
}
</pre>

<p>Many of the above utilities recognize sentinel values as input or
output file names, such as <code>:stdin:</code> for standard input;
the complete set of such special names is the constants of {@link
org.marketcetera.util.file.SpecialNames}.</p>
