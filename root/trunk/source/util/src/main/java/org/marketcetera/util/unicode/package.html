<p>Unicode en/decoding with BOMs, including I/O stream support.</p>

<p>Unicode handling in Java can get a bit confusing, esp. in the
context of byte order marks (BOMs). Java
has <a href="http://bugs.sun.com/bugdatabase/view_bug.do?bug_id=6378911">flip-flopped
on the handling of BOMs in UTF-8</a> (Java 6 does not provide any),
provides BOMs for UTF-16 (see {@link java.nio.charset.Charset}), and
does not provide BOMs for UTF-32 (unless the <em>UTF-32LE</em>
or <em>UTF-32BE</em> variants are used). Also, as of Java 5, Java
moved from UCS-2 to UTF-16 for its internal string representation,
enhancing the range of byte streams that Java can en/decode. This
package provides an improved framework for handling BOMs; the classes
herein are tested with unicode code points beyond those covered by
UCS-2 (thus exercising the new UTF-16 representation of Java
strings).</p>


<h3>Foundation</h3>

<p>{@link org.marketcetera.util.unicode.UnicodeCharset} is the basic
tie-in to the JDK unicode facilities. Each instance is just a wrapper
around a unicode {@link java.nio.charset.Charset} instance, and obeys
the standard Java semantics for BOMs (with their inconsistencies).</p>

<p>{@link org.marketcetera.util.unicode.Signature} is a generic
signature detector in the header of a byte stream. Enumeration
constants are defined for the unicode BOM signatures, but this class
makes no attempt to handle a map between signatures and charsets.</p>

<p>{@link org.marketcetera.util.unicode.SignatureCharset} pairs up
charsets to signatures that can mark those charsets. All charsets can
occur either without a signature ({@link
org.marketcetera.util.unicode.Signature#NONE}), or with the BOM
defined by the unicode standard specifically for each charset.</p>

<p>{@link org.marketcetera.util.unicode.Serialization} groups a list
of {@link org.marketcetera.util.unicode.SignatureCharset}
instances. We check a byte source against all signatures in a
serialization (in order), in order to determine the charset we should
use.</p>

<p>Finally, {@link org.marketcetera.util.unicode.DecodingStrategy}
groups a list of {@link org.marketcetera.util.unicode.Serialization}
instances. Functionally, it is similar to {@link
org.marketcetera.util.unicode.Serialization}, but it occupies a higher
level of abstraction, making it easy to define signature-detection
strategies using {@link org.marketcetera.util.unicode.Serialization}
instances as building blocks.</p>


<h3>I/O</h3>

<p>In addition to the basic foundation, this package exposes readers
and writers that are BOM-aware. This includes:

<ul>

<li>Readers who can recognize a BOM, and thus automatically determine
a byte stream's charset.</li>

<li>Writers who can place a BOM at the header of a byte stream, thus
specifying the stream's charset.</li>

</ul>

<p>There are basic input stream/output stream converters to a reader
({@link org.marketcetera.util.unicode.UnicodeInputStreamReader}) or
writer ({@link
org.marketcetera.util.unicode.UnicodeOutputStreamWriter}), as well as
a file-based reader ({@link
org.marketcetera.util.unicode.UnicodeFileReader}) and writer ({@link
org.marketcetera.util.unicode.UnicodeFileWriter}).</p>
