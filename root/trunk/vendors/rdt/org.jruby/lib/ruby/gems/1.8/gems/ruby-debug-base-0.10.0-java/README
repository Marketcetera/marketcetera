This is really far from complete. Rather backup and sharing for the
case, someone would like to jump-in in this *very* early stage. A lot of
code is/might_be just wrong. Better to go away and return in few
days/weeks :)

Please contact me at martin.krauskopf@sun.com if you would like to
contribute, retake, send patches ... cooperate in whatever manner. See
the 'initiating' thread on the jruby@dev mailing list.

Note that the current content is a 'patch' against current JRuby's
trunk. So just copy 'src' dir to the JRuby's sources. To compile you
also need to apply jruby-patch.diff to JRuby's trunk.

This code should now be capable of installing as a gem which can replace ruby-debug-base.  
Run rake install_gem to compile, build jar, build gem, and install it into a jruby gem install 
directory.  Running gem package will build a gem.
