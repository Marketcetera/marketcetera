/**
 * A Java element delta describes changes in Java element between two discrete
 * points in time. Given a delta, clients can access the element that has
 * changed, and any children that have changed.
 * <p>
 * Deltas have a different status depending on the kind of change they
 * represent. The list below summarizes each status (as returned by
 * <code>getKind</code>) and its meaning (see individual constants for a more
 * detailled description):
 * <ul>
 * <li><code>ADDED</code> - The element described by the delta has been
 * added.</li>
 * <li><code>REMOVED</code> - The element described by the delta has been
 * removed.</li>
 * <li><code>CHANGED</code> - The element described by the delta has been
 * changed in some way. Specification of the type of change is provided by
 * <code>getFlags</code> which returns the following values:
 * <ul>
 * <li><code>F_ADDED_TO_CLASSPATH</code> - A classpath entry corresponding to
 * the element has been added to the project's classpath. This flag is only
 * valid if the element is an <code>IPackageFragmentRoot</code>.</li>
 * <li><code>F_ARCHIVE_CONTENT_CHANGED</code> - The contents of an archive
 * has changed in some way. This flag is only valid if the element is an
 * <code>IPackageFragmentRoot</code> which is an archive.</li>
 * <li><code>F_CHILDREN</code> - A child of the element has changed in some
 * way. This flag is only valid if the element is an <code>IParent</code>.</li>
 * <li><code>F_CLASSPATH_REORDER</code> - A classpath entry corresponding to
 * the element has changed position in the project's classpath. This flag is
 * only valid if the element is an <code>IPackageFragmentRoot</code>.</li>
 * <li><code>F_CLOSED</code> - The underlying <code>IProject</code> has
 * been closed. This flag is only valid if the element is an
 * <code>IJavaProject</code>.</li>
 * <li><code>F_CONTENT</code> - The contents of the element have been
 * altered. This flag is only valid for elements which correspond to files.</li>
 * <li><code>F_FINE_GRAINED</code> - The delta is a fine-grained delta, that
 * is, an analysis down to the members level was done to determine if there were
 * structural changes to members of the element.</li>
 * <li><code>F_MODIFIERS</code> - The modifiers on the element have changed
 * in some way. This flag is only valid if the element is an
 * <code>IMember</code>.</li>
 * <li><code>F_OPENED</code> - The underlying <code>IProject</code> has
 * been opened. This flag is only valid if the element is an
 * <code>IJavaProject</code>.</li>
 * <li><code>F_REMOVED_FROM_CLASSPATH</code> - A classpath entry
 * corresponding to the element has been removed from the project's classpath.
 * This flag is only valid if the element is an
 * <code>IPackageFragmentRoot</code>.</li>
 * <li><code>F_SOURCEATTACHED</code> - The source attachment path or the
 * source attachment root path of a classpath entry corresponding to the element
 * was added. This flag is only valid if the element is an
 * <code>IPackageFragmentRoot</code>.</li>
 * <li><code>F_SOURCEDETACHED</code> - The source attachment path or the
 * source attachment root path of a classpath entry corresponding to the element
 * was removed. This flag is only valid if the element is an
 * <code>IPackageFragmentRoot</code>.</li>
 * <li><code>F_SUPER_TYPES</code> - One of the supertypes of an
 * <code>IType</code> has changed</li>.
 * </ul>
 * </li>
 * </ul>
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Move operations are indicated by other change flags, layered on top of the
 * change flags described above. If element A is moved to become B, the delta
 * for the change in A will have status <code>REMOVED</code>, with change
 * flag <code>F_MOVED_TO</code>. In this case, <code>getMovedToElement</code>
 * on delta A will return the handle for B. The delta for B will have status
 * <code>ADDED</code>, with change flag <code>F_MOVED_FROM</code>, and
 * <code>getMovedFromElement</code> on delta B will return the handle for A.
 * (Note, the handle to A in this case represents an element that no longer
 * exists).
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Note that the move change flags only describe the changes to a single
 * element, they do not imply anything about the parent or children of the
 * element.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * The <code>F_ADDED_TO_CLASSPATH</code>,
 * <code>F_REMOVED_FROM_CLASSPATH</code> and <code>F_CLASSPATH_REORDER</code>
 * flags are triggered by changes to a project's classpath. They do not mean
 * that the underlying resource was added, removed or changed. For example, if a
 * project P already contains a folder src, then adding a classpath entry with
 * the 'P/src' path to the project's classpath will result in an
 * <code>IJavaElementDelta</code> with the <code>F_ADDED_TO_CLASSPATH</code>
 * flag for the <code>IPackageFragmentRoot</code> P/src. On the contrary, if a
 * resource is physically added, removed or changed and this resource
 * corresponds to a classpath entry of the project, then an
 * <code>IJavaElementDelta</code> with the <code>ADDED</code>,
 * <code>REMOVED</code>, or <code>CHANGED</code> kind will be fired.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Note that when a source attachment path or a source attachment root path is
 * changed, then the flags of the delta contain both
 * <code>F_SOURCEATTACHED</code> and <code>F_SOURCEDETTACHED</code>.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * No assumptions should be made on whether the java element delta tree is
 * rooted at the <code>IJavaModel</code> level or not.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * <code>IJavaElementDelta</code> object are not valid outside the dynamic
 * scope of the notification.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * This interface is not intended to be implemented by clients.
 * </p>
