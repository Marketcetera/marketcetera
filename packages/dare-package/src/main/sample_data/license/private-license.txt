6.2 Dispute Resolution.

You further acknowledge and agree that it is preferable to resolve all disputes between Us and You confidentially, individually and in an expeditious and inexpensive manner. We and You accordingly acknowledge and agree that private dispute resolution is preferable to court actions. Before commencing any arbitration in the manner set out in Section 6.3 below, We and You shall first attempt to resolve any dispute or differences between the both of us by way of good faith negotiation. The good faith negotiation shall commence by each of Us and You communicating our position regarding the complaint, claim, dispute or controversy to the other party, and how the both of us should resolve the dispute. We and You shall then make good faith efforts to negotiate a resolution of the claim, dispute or controversy. Neither We nor You shall commence any arbitral proceedings unless and until the good faith negotiation fails.
6.3 ARBITRATION. ANY CLAIM, DISPUTE OR CONTROVERSY (WHETHER IN CONTRACT, TORT OR OTHERWISE, WHETHER PRE-EXISTING, PRESENT OR FUTURE, AND INCLUDING STATUTORY, COMMON LAW, INTENTIONAL TORT AND EQUITABLE CLAIMS CAPABLE IN LAW OF BEING SUBMITTED TO BINDING ARBITRATION) AGAINST US, Our agents, employees, officers, directors, successors, assigns or affiliates (collectively, for purposes of this paragraph, “Licensor Group”) arising from or relating to this Agreement, its interpretation or the breach, termination or validity thereof, the relationships between the parties, whether pre-existing, present or future (including, to the full extent permitted by applicable law, relationships with third parties who are not signatories to this Agreement), Licensor Group’s advertising or any related purchase SHALL BE RESOLVED EXCLUSIVELY AND FINALLY BY BINDING ARBITRATION ADMINISTERED BY THE NATIONAL ARBITRATION FORUM (“NAF”) under its Code of Procedure and any specific procedures for the resolution of small claims and/or consumer disputes then in effect (available via the Internet at <http://www.arb-forum.com>, or via telephone at 1-800-474-2371). The arbitration will be limited solely to the dispute or controversy between Customer and Licensor Group. Any award of the arbitrator(s) shall be final and binding on each of us, and may be entered as a judgment in any court of competent jurisdiction. Information may be obtained, and claims may be filed with the NAF at P.O. Box 50191, Minneapolis, MN 55405, or by email at <file@arb-forum.com>, or by online filing at <http://www.arb-forum.com>.
