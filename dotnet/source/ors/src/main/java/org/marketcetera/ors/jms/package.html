<p>Spring-wrapped JMS utilities.</p>

<p>The classes in this package provide utilities to create
Spring-wrapped JMS connections with minimal use of Spring and
JMS. This is done in the following steps:</p>

<ol>

<li><p>Initialize an instance of {@link
org.marketcetera.ors.jms.JmsManager} using standard JMS connection
factories supplied via Spring configuration (e.g.  {@link
org.marketcetera.ors.config.SpringConfig}.</p></li>

<li><p>Retrieve from the {@link org.marketcetera.ors.jms.JmsManager}
its outgoing connection manager {@link
org.marketcetera.ors.jms.OutgoingJmsFactory}, and use its methods to
obtain a Spring JMS template, which you then use to send
messages.</p></li>

<li><p>Retrieve from the {@link org.marketcetera.ors.jms.JmsManager}
its incoming connection manager {@link
org.marketcetera.ors.jms.IncomingJmsFactory} to register a handler of
your own making (that implements {@link
org.marketcetera.ors.jms.ReplyHandler} or {@link
org.marketcetera.ors.jms.ReceiveOnlyHandler}); your handler will be
called when messages are received.</p></li>

</ol>

<p>This package supports both queues and topics.</p>
