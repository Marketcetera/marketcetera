- remove style service as a bad idea
- convert fix session panes to use inner classes
- traderAdmin should have view fix sessions permission
- expand FIX wizard to allow specification of multiple host/port combinations for failover?
-- either that or need to do something that allows freeform settings to be added instead of just the normal ones
- enforce patterns on fix session attributes in fix session wizard
- add new permission for activate/deactivate users and use them in UserView context menu
- create common dialog/confirmation pattern for context menus in PhotonServices and use for all relevant context menu items
- add ActivateUser to AdminClient and use in UserView context menu

- if md client goes offline, mark all views as disabled
- md client comes back online, resubmit md requests

* Bugs *
========
- market data client returns no available capabilities
- broker algos in order ticket
- custom fields in order ticket
- transfer text to order in order ticket
- peg to midpoint in order ticket
- order ticket not formatted with last know values
- replace order ticket values not filled out
- menus are not fully recursive: only go to top level
- incorporate session id validator in fix session wizard session identity page
- failed fix session actions return "UNKNOWN" instead of a useful error message
- defining a FIX session w/o a heartbeatint causes all kinds of havoc on client and server
- update fix session adds new session instead of updating old one
- add fix session shows empty session name in the update message
- check permissions for add FIX session
- can't delete user with supervisor permissions
- can't delete user with roles
- need to sort out password hashing/sending/authenticating between client and server
- adminClient requires old password when changing password, but that requires keeping it around, which is a security issue. remove the old password parameter from the call.
- PhotonServices.successStyle needs to match initial style, instead adds a light boundary
- deactive user causes stale row error
- add check to add/update user to see if the username is already in use
- need to add permissions to roles add or update
- changing permissions doesn't work in adding/updating permissions
- add admin views
-- supervisor permissions

*****************
* strategy view *
*****************
- reverify strategy before starting
- how to identify the strategy instance for events emitted through the strategy client? maybe create a special kind of client that knows the strategy instance? otherwise, we run the risk of a strategy impersonating another strategy.
- cancel big uploads
- run on different cluster members? report strategy status on all cluster members
- compare meta data on activate or discard?
- run multiple versions of an uploaded stratergy w/o having to upload it again (duplicate from strategy context menu?)
- nonce should not be in the strategy instance - pass it as a parameter to the new strategy instance and it can be stored adjacently
- combine upload progress bar and status, perhaps using a VBox as the cell type
- hash should not be returned to the client as this is a security risk. someone could calculate a hash-collision for a jar and push that one up instead?
- remove hash from FileUploadMetaData
- add type to FileUploadMetaData and remove hardcoded type in StrategyRpcServer
- move verification from StrategyRPCServer to StrategyServiceImpl
- add attribute to strategy instance:
-- auto start

x merge 1102 to 4.1.x
- update build instructions
x make 4.1.x the main branch
