	<dd><pre class="commandsyntax">{ B | S | SS | SSE} <em class="replaceable">quantity</em> <em class="replaceable">symbol</em> <em class="replaceable">price</em> [<em class="replaceable">timeInForce</em> [<em class="replaceable">account</em>]]
	</pre></dd>
	<dd>This command starts with one of "B" (buy), "S" (sell), "SS" (sell short), "SSE" (sell short exempt). That
	is followed by a quantity which must be an integer.  After the quantity comes a symbol.  A symbol can consist
	of any string of non-whitespace characters. Next comes the price, which can be either numeric or integer format.
	Finally two optional components, the time in force and the account.  Time in force can be one of "DAY" (day),
	"GTC" (good 'til cancel), "FOK" (fill or kill), "CLO" (at the close), "OPG" (at the opening), "IOC" (immediate 
	or cancel). The account can be any string of non-whitespace characters.  Note that if you have an account, you
	must also have a time in force.</dd>
