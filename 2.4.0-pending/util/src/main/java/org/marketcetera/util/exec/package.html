<p>Process execution.</p>

<p>Process execution in Java is harder than it seems. {@link
java.lang.ProcessBuilder} simplifies some of the necessary steps, but
still does not address several aspects of process management that this
package addresses. Specifically, {@link
org.marketcetera.util.exec.Exec} provides execution of a process
with the following enhancements:</p>

<ul>

<li><p>Routing/capture of its standard output and error streams. Both
streams are always routed to the same destination {@link
org.marketcetera.util.exec.Disposition}, which can be in-memory
capture, or redirection to the parent process standard output or error
stream (both child streams go to the same parent stream).</p></li>

<li><p>Exit code capture. The exit code of the child process is
captured (always) alongside the process output (if in-memory
disposition was elected) in {@link
org.marketcetera.util.exec.ExecResult}.</p></li>

<li><p>Synchronous execution. The parent blocks while waiting for the
child to complete. The package assumes children do not need any data
to be provided in their standard input steam, or else the parent may
wait indefinitely on a blocked child.</p></li>

<li><p>Setting working directory. The working directory of the child
can be set before the child process is started.</p></li>

</ul>

<p>All of the above functionality is available via simple static calls
into methods of {@link org.marketcetera.util.exec.Exec}.</p>
